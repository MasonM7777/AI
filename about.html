                </figure>
                
                <p>AI's usefulness in creating art lies in its ability to enhance and expand 
                    human creativity by offering new tools and perspectives. Artists can use 
                    AI to generate unique designs, patterns, and visual compositions that 
                    they might not have conceived on their own. For example, AI can analyze 
                    thousands of styles and artworks to produce pieces that blend different 
                    techniques or aesthetics, giving artists fresh inspiration and sparking new 
                    ideas. This can be particularly helpful in fields like digital art, graphic 
                    design, and animation, where AI can speed up the creative process by 
                    automating tasks like color matching, object generation, or image enhancements.<p>

            <div class="desktop">
                <p>Additionally, AI democratizes the art world by making creative tools accessible 
                    to people with little or no formal training. With AI-driven platforms, users 
                    can create artwork by simply inputting ideas or preferences, letting the AI 
                    handle the technical execution. This allows more people to engage with art creation,
                    breaking down barriers and encouraging experimentation. AI also enables the 
                    exploration of interactive and generative art, where the piece evolves in 
                    real-time based on user input or environmental factors, opening up entirely 
                    new forms of artistic expression.</p>

            <h1>AI use and helpfulness</h1>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/ai-help (1).jpg" alt="Human and AI fingers touching" class="round">
                    <figcaption>Humans and Ai Working together</figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <p>AI is helpful and useful to humans because it can perform tasks more efficiently 
                    and accurately than traditional methods, often handling large amounts of data 
                    or complex calculations that would be difficult or time-consuming for humans. 
                    In industries like healthcare, AI can analyze medical data, helping doctors detect 
                    diseases earlier or recommend treatments with greater precision. In business, 
                    AI automates routine tasks, allowing employees to focus on higher-level work, 
                    improving productivity and decision-making. Its ability to learn and adapt over time
                    means that AI solutions can continuously improve, offering smarter results with each use.</p>

            <div class="desktop">
                <p>Another reason AI is valuable is its ability to assist in areas where human limitations 
                    exist, such as processing information at a rapid scale or providing insights across 
                    multiple fields. AI-powered virtual assistants help with everyday tasks, from managing 
                    schedules to answering questions, making it easier to stay organized and informed. 
                    In fields like environmental research and engineering, AI is crucial for solving 
                    global challenges by analyzing patterns, optimizing resources, and predicting outcomes 
                    with high accuracy. Overall, AI's utility lies in its capacity to augment human 
                    abilities and drive innovation in countless sectors.</p>
